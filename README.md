# energy-data-analysis
This repository is a personal project to analyze countries' energy investments.
Since I am Brazilian, I focus my analysis in Brazil, but you are welcome to clone the repository and change the `Location` of your choice.
This project is only for research/fun purposes, but I intend to expand it and make something useful for the world with it someday.
