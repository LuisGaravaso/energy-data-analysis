# energy-data-analysis
This repository is a personal project to analyze countries' energy investments.
Since I am Brazilian, I focus my analysis in Brazil, but you are welcome to clone the repository and change the `Location` of your choice.
This project is only for research/fun purposes, but I intend to expand it and make something useful for the world with it someday.

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/LuisGaravaso/energy-data-analysis
```

## Usage

Just open the Jupyter Notebook and use the predefined functions `etl` and `plotting_prep` with a `Location` of your choice.

## Collaborating

Send me a connection request on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisgaravaso/
That way you can send me files, urls or advice on the analysis.

## Future Work

1. Gathering more data on Brazil to predict future renewables share
2. Get more info on **Colombia** and **New Zealand** to see how they have been investing lately
